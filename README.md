## Problem statement
AtliQ Grands is a well-established luxury hotel brand with a strong presence across India for the past 20 years. Recently, the company has seen a decline in market share and revenue within the business and luxury segments—largely due to aggressive competition and the absence of data-driven decision-making.
To address these challenges, the management has decided to leverage Business and Data Intelligence as a strategic initiative.

Since AtliQ Grands lacks an internal analytics team, the revenue management department has brought in a third-party service provider to analyze historical data and deliver actionable insights to support future growth.
